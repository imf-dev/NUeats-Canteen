# Dashboard Database Integration

## Summary

The Dashboard has been successfully updated to fetch data from the Supabase database instead of using demo data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `src/lib/dashboardService.js`
A new service file that handles all dashboard data fetching from Supabase:

- **`getStatsCards()`** - Fetches dashboard statistics:
  - Active Orders (Pending, Preparing, Ready)
  - Completed Orders (today)
  - Today's Revenue with comparison to yesterday
  - Low Stock Items (placeholder for future implementation)

- **`getWeeklyData()`** - Fetches sales data for the last 7 days:
  - Daily revenue
  - Daily order counts
  - Average order value per day

- **`getTopSellingItems()`** - Fetches top 5 selling items this week:
  - Based on completed orders from the last 7 days
  - Sorted by quantity sold
  - Includes revenue and product details

- **`getCurrentOrders()`** - Fetches active orders only:
  - **Only shows orders with status: Pending, Preparing, or Ready**
  - Excludes Completed and Cancelled orders
  - Includes customer name from auth metadata
  - Shows order items and total amount

- **`updateOrderStatus()`** - Updates order status in the database

- **`getDashboardData()`** - Fetches all dashboard data in parallel

### 2. Updated `src/screens/Dashboard.jsx`

- Replaced demo data import with database service import
- Added loading state with `LoadingScreen` component
- Implemented `fetchDashboardData()` async function
- Added `handleOrderStatusChange()` to update order status and refresh data
- Connected the `onOrderStatusChange` handler to `DashboardCurrentOrders` component

## Database Schema Used

The integration uses the following Supabase tables:

1. **`orders`** - Order records with status, total_amount, created_at
2. **`order_items`** - Items in each order with product_id, quantity, price
3. **`menu_items`** - Product information (name, category, price)
4. **`auth.users`** - Customer information (email, metadata)

## Features

### Current Orders Display
- **Only shows active orders**: Pending, Preparing, Ready
- Completed and Cancelled orders are excluded
- Real-time order status updates
- Customer names from auth metadata

### Statistics
- Real-time count of active and completed orders
- Today's revenue with percentage change from yesterday
- All data fetched from actual database records

### Weekly Sales Chart
- Last 7 days of sales data
- Daily revenue and order counts
- Calculated average order values

### Top Selling Items
- Based on completed orders from last 7 days
- Top 5 items by quantity sold
- Shows actual revenue data

## Usage

The dashboard will automatically fetch data when loaded. To refresh the data:
- Order status changes trigger automatic refresh
- Page reload will fetch fresh data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Analytics**: Add more detailed performance metrics
2. **Real-time Updates**: Add Supabase real-time subscriptions for live order updates
3. **Date Range Filters**: Allow users to select custom date ranges
4. **More Analytics**: Add hourly sales patterns, customer segments, etc.
